# ADM---HV1

First ADM Homework (PROBLEM 1 + PROBLEM 2 + PROBLEM 3).

For PROBLEM 1 and PROBLEM 2, I uploaded two files: The first is made up of all the exercise codes (the exercises from PROBLEM 1 and the challenges from PROBLEM 2), put together in a single script, and it is called 'scripts_ciciani_214039.py'; The second is also made up of all the exercise codes, but this time divided by cells to increase their comprehensibility: its name is 'scripts_ciciani_214039_notebook.ipynb'.

I also uploaded a PDF file containing the screenshots of the submission page of HackerRank. The file is called "submissions.pdf".

For PROBLEM 3 I uploaded a PDF file called "AWS_ciciani_214039.pdf" containing the screesnhots attesting to completion of the AWS forms.

for this exam I read up on the following sites: stack overflow, python documentation and W3shool

I have been able to develop some of my knowledge of Python for the company I work for
